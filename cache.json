We make it fast and easy for medium to large size manufacturers to find suppliers for industrial parts.\nWhy does this matter? Buyers at manufacturing companies face high pressure to cut costs. Supplier sourcing is still very manual and takes up to 45% of a buyer's time. Due to the lack of research time, buyers rarely close deals at optimal conditions. Recently, Covid-19 and material shortages have further accelerated the need for more transparent supply chains.\nIsabel came across this problem during her work as an investment analyst.

With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",
