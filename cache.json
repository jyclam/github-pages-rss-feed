Today we’re launching a new major feature: co-founder matching (https://www.startupschool.org/cofounder-matching). Interested founders can create a profile, input their requirements (location, time commitment, skills, etc) and quickly review screened candidates. We don’t charge for this or take any equity in the teams formed.\nFounders face lots of hard problems at the earliest stages—building an MVP, finding users, finding investors—but finding a co-founder can be uniquely difficult. Even if you have a strong network, your friends may not be startup-oriented, and the ones who are may not be available on the same schedule you are [1]. And if…",

On the tech side, Enso is a visual and textual programming language (you can switch from graph to code and back). On the business side, it's a workflow builder that makes it easy for analysts without a programming background to automate data-driven processes simply by connecting visual components together. Our GUI is like an IDE, but with a graph editor alongside the code. Currently, we’re focused on data analysis—data preparation, blending, and analytics (both in-memory and SQL). You can see a video of how it works here: https://youtu.be/fQvWMoOjmQk.\nWe used to be called Luna and were lucky to have a few big threads on HN over the years [1][2][3][4][5].
