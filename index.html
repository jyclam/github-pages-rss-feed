                    <span>Hey HN,
This is Celine, Julien, and Narae of Flowly (https://www.flowly.world/). Flowly is an app that combines VR and biofeedback training to help people manage pain, reduce anxiety, and increase relaxation (we send every member a VR headset and Realtime HR Sensor to use) . We started this company to serve the 1 in 3 Americans who suffer from chronic pain and we’re now backed by the NIH and National Institute of Drug Abuse.
The opioid crisis has exposed how prevalent chronic pain is and how inaccessible and limited pain management solutions are today. Importantly, many pain management tools don&#x27;t address all aspects of pain because pain encompasses physical pain, but the top symptoms of chronic pain actually include anxiety, depression, and feelings of social isolation.

                    <span>Heya! Not the usual sort of thing to be posted here, but I wanted to show off what I made yesterday. Here&#x27;s a sample page about H1-B visas issued in Bogota:

The code is source-available (not open source) at 
. It&#x27;s my first time choosing a source-available license over MIT, mainly out of fear of existing immigration startups just gobbling this data and code up; frankly I didn&#x27;t think the implications through though, I just threw a safe license on there.
The way the project works is:
- Use requests-html to find publicly available PDFs from government pages
- Use camelot to OCR the PDFs and extract data tables from them
- Since the previous step takes crazy long for my tastes (around 8000 pages at around 5 seconds each) I&#x27;ve used dask to split the work into chunks and parallel-process them across my laptop&#x27;s CPUs.
- Do data cleanup and processing with pandas, and save all of it to a SQLite file.
- Take data from the SQLite file with next.js and generate a static HTML page for each possible embassy - visa type combination
- The pages use ECharts to visualize data, and Bulma as a CSS framework
- Build and host each commit via Netlify
- But proxy to Netlify from CloudFlare, which I believe has more edge locations in the free plan
- Collect any donations via Ko-Fi
- Use Google Analytics to have a general idea about visitor counts
- Use FullStory session recordings to find out about bugs – I&#x27;ve fixed quite a few and I think I&#x27;ll probably remove this tracking after a bit of time
…and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at now. I&#x27;m pretty happy about the results. Most pages load in less than 300ms, which is something I care about all too much. More importantly, I&#x27;ve shared the site with some immigration communities I&#x27;m part of, and the response has been very positive! Let me know what y&#x27;all think.

In sum, they can lead to lousy maintainability, slow execution time, and — in the worst case — tests you cannot trust. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this article, I will talk about common mistakes developers make, at least in my experience, and, of course, how to avoid them. Testing doesn’t need to be painful, after all.</span>

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>

                    <span>What makes relational selector one of the most requested features and how are we, as developers, working around not having it? In this article, we’re going to check the early spec of the :has selector, and see how it should improve the CSS workflow once it’s released.</span>

                    <span>When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.
The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>
