                    <span>Normally, a project will have a set of pre-determined font sizes, usually as variables named in such a way that seeks some semblance of order and consistency. Any project of considerable size can use something like that. There are always …

                    <span>The HN attitude about blockchain is overwhelmingly negative.
Yet what I see with smart contracts on blockchain, such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a huge potential for change and a big open sea of opportunity for disruptive tech and startups.
If you don&#x27;t know what that is:
You can run code on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The user pays to run your code, instead of you paying to run the server that serves them the code.
This is because everyone who&#x27;s running an Ethereum node actually has a copy of your code in the blockchain.
This is called a &quot;smart contract&quot; but enough people have experimented with it that they&#x27;ve actually built decentralised applications - dApps for short.
This seems like it has huge disruptive potential. Mark Cuban has talked about how he could sell tickets as NFTs on the blockchain, and get a percentage of resell, forever.
You could in theory build something similar for Airbnb or Uber on the blockchain - just NFT a house/day and then sell it on the blockchain. Same thing with Uber - drivers could auction off their time in a blockchain dApp.
Because devs don&#x27;t pay to keep their code in the ETH blockchain, you can just build software and it will &quot;run&quot; forever, at no cost to the developer.
This is a radical change and imo a huge avenue for new innovation.
But this is hardly talked about here in HN.
Let&#x27;s ignore, if possible, the whole &quot;proof of work is bad for the environment&quot; question (all I&#x27;ll say about that is proof of stake is real and in production with DOT/ALGO and that&#x27;s a 99% reduction in energy consumption). I know it&#x27;s tempting to go in this direction but again - let&#x27;s assume all crypto is proof of stake for the sake of argument.

                    <span>Hi HN, We are Wojciech and Sylwia, the co-founders of Enso (https://enso.org). On the tech side, Enso is a visual and textual programming language (you can switch from graph to code and back). On the business side, it&#x27;s a workflow builder that makes it easy for analysts without a programming background to automate data-driven processes simply by connecting visual components together. Our GUI is like an IDE, but with a graph editor alongside the code. Currently, we’re focused on data analysis—data preparation, blending, and analytics (both in-memory and SQL). You can see a video of how it works here: https://youtu.be/fQvWMoOjmQk.
We used to be called Luna and were lucky to have a few big threads on HN over the years [1][2][3][4][5]. Eventually we went into heads-down mode to make a producti…</span>

Please state the location and include REMOTE if you are open to building a company remotely. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.
Please only post if you personally are the founder (or one of the co-founders) of the startup. No recruiting firms, venture builders, or job boards. Only one post per company (how many co-founders can one look for anyway). Please explain on a high level what your company does.
Commenters: please don&#x27;t reply to these posts telling people why their idea won&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s off topic here.
Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in committing yourself to a co-founder role. No &quot;CTO for hire&quot; companies!

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>

                    <span>Spoiler alert: tooltips, modals, tabs, carousels, and dropdown menus are some of the user interface components that require more than CSS. To ensure accessibility of your interface, JavaScript is a necessary addition to accomplish focus management, respond to keyboard events, and toggle ARIA attributes.</span>

                    <span>When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.
The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>
