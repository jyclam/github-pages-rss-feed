Sydney and I met in 42, a software engineering school in Paris, and started working together on different tech projects last year. While working on our last business, a SaaS management platform for SMEs, we were in a squad of 4 to 5 people and often found ourselves writing direct messages in Slack about pull requests. We were telling each other things like ‘Hey Arthur, I’ve updated my last pull request feature/zoom_integration, do you have time to check it out soon?’ or “it’s been two days, do you have time to review feature/user_settings today, here is the link: github/axolo-co/api.axolo.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
