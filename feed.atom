        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My father-in-law passed away three days ago. As it happens with these things, it was too soon. It's always too soon. He was like a second father to me.
He had a career in the Italian navy, a retired Admiral. He was a great storyteller, and had a tough and difficult character, but lots of good things, deep inside. Full of integrity, honorable.
Thankfully we moved back to Italy a few months ago after a dozen years abroad, and spent this time mostly with him and his wife, in their hometown, Venezia. I can't imagine what it would be if we stayed in San Francisco, and this death happened at distance.
Does any of you have a time machine at hand? Both me and my wife would like to tell him how much we love him, and hear his great stories one last time.
Missing that, any suggestion on how you coped with death?
It is not my first time; but it is the first time in the last decade or so. I know, I'm lucky.
One last thing: I don't want to just "ask", but I'd like to contribute something. This is my suggestion for you, actually my prescription for you: if you still have parents, or parents-in-law that you really love, invite them out for dinner, and ask them to tell you stories of their past. Then, before saying goodbye, tell them how much you love them. One day, far away in the future I hope, you will thank me.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.]]></summary>
